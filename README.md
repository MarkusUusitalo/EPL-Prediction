# Predicts English Premier League results using pandas dataframe. 

The code has been implemented from the instructions in a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0irmDBWLrco&t=134s with some modifications.

The original code predicted if the chosen team were going to win or not. 

This code is modified to predict the result including a possible draw and accuracy has been improved with additional, relevant columns from csv file such as "xg", "xga". Additionally, "pkatt" column has been left away from the chosen columns.
