# Predicts English Premier League results using pandas dataframe. 

The code has been implemented from a base of a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0irmDBWLrco&t=134s with modifications.

The original code predicted if the chosen team were going to win or not. 

This code is modified to predict the result including a possible draw and accuracy has been improved by, e.g., with additional, relevant columns from csv file such as "xg", "xga". Additionally, "pkatt" column has been left away from the chosen columns.
